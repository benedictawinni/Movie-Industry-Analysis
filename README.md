# Movie-Industry-Analysis

This analysis focused on getting insight about factors that affect movies profit and the characteristics of beneficial movies (movies that bring high profit to the investor). I used Regression Analysis (Multiple Linear, Ridge, and Lasso) methods to solve this problem. From the analysis, we may conclude that votes and budget of the movie significantly explain the profit. Furthermore, investors can invest in the movie industry with genres Family, Action, Animation, Adventure; rating: G, PG, or PG-13; and high budget which are expected to give high profit.

Hopefully this analysis can be useful for those who read it. Thank you!
